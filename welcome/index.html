    <h2>Welcome to the Code Club World family!</h2>

    <p><strong>It is our core belief that every child should have the chance to learn to code no matter what their financial situation, this is the reason that Code Club World is free and open.</strong></p>
    <p>Code Club World is a not for profit organisation funded by donations from the public. We'll use funding to create more materials for you to teach with and create a team that support those that lead Code Club communities in their own countries.</p>

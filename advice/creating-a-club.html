        <h3>Introduction to Code Club World</h3>

        <p>Code Club World is a worldwide network of free volunteer-led after-school coding clubs for children aged 9-11. It is based on <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club UK</a> but the main difference is that volunteer support for Code Club World is offered by the volunteer community themselves.</p>

        <p>We’ve had people contact us from all over the globe asking us if they can set up a Code Club in their country. We’re a small operation here in the UK, so we’re been unable to support anyone outside the UK. But, we’ve been listening and we don’t feel that Code Club should be restricted to just this small island. Which is why we’re bringing you a frameworkCode Club World.</p>

        <p>Code Club is a group of approximately 12 children learning to program under the expert guidance of a computer programmer.
        We create projects for volunteers to teach at after school coding clubs. The projects we make teach children how to program by showing them how to make computer games, animations and websites. Our volunteers go to their local primary school or other venue, such as a library, for an hour a week and teach one project a week.</p>

        <p>We write a new set of projects every school term. Each term the students will progress and learn more whilst at the same time using their imaginations and making creative projects. Terms 1 &amp; 2 will use Scratch to teach the basics of programming. Term 3 will teach the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. Term 4 will teach Python and so on.</p>

        <p><strong>Why should children learn to code?</strong></p>

        <p>Learning to code is an important skill now we’re living in a digital age. It’s not just enough for children to know how to use technology. They should know how it works too. Learning to code doesn’t just mean you can become a developer it strengthens problem solving skills and logical thinking and supports key academic subjects such as science, maths and technology.</p>

        <p><strong>Our philosophy</strong></p>

        <p>Code Club is about fun, creativity and learning through exploring. It’s important that the children enjoy their time at Code Club and that it doesn’t feel like another school lesson. They should understand that they’re in charge of the computer, and can (and should) make it do what they want, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Other benefits of Code Club, such as learning about computational thinking, or developing expertise in coding, are secondary to these two objectives. Having said that, children will absorb all these wonderful skills as they work through the projects rather than through didactic teaching.</p>

        <p>Our projects are written by programmers then tested with children at 20 pilot schools across the UK. We ask them to rate our projects and they told us they are 92% fun! When we're testing we look for air punches and fist bumps. That means they like them!</p>

        <h3>Finding a venue</h3>

        <p>If you want to volunteer to run a Code Club, you’ll need to find somewhere suitable to run one. You’ll need to find somewhere with adequate computer facilities with access to the internet.</p>

        <p>For example primary schools in the UK have been highly successful as students can learn with their friends and grow and develop together. Libraries and community centres, too, might be a good place to run one outside of school hours and weekends.</p>

        <p>The important thing is to contact the venue directly, and organise to meet them face-to-face. Explain what Code Club is and take along any relevant materials. Then you can propose a regular day and time to set up your club! Then register your club on this website and download the materials from Github.</p>

        <h3>Running your club</h3>

        <p><strong>Top tips on running your club</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Each Code Club lasts for 1 hour and happens once a week.</li>
          <li>You will need to print and staple a copy of project instructions for each child or pair of children.</li>
          <li>Practise the project before you go and teach it so you're ahead of the children.</li>
          <li>Please allow for travel time too.</li>
          <li>You will not be allowed to charge for you club under any circumstance. Code Club is free for all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Creating a positive learning environment</h4>

        <p>If you're not used to it, working with children can seem a daunting prospect. But fear not! Follow these simple tips and you will be leading a great Code Club in no time.</p>

        <p><strong>Establish a routine</strong></p>

        <p>Running an awesome Code Club can be mostly be achieved by establishing routines and sticking to them. If children know what to do and what to expect then you will find it easier to teach and they will find it easier to learn. Before starting the club consider the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What do you want the children to do when they first walk in the room?</li>
          <li>Should they sit and wait quietly for all the children to arrive and further instructions?  Should they log on and get started right away?</li>
          <li>If a child is stuck on any part of the project instructions what should they do?</li>
          <li>Should they raise their hand and wait for you to come to them?</li>
          <li>Is it okay for them to call your name across the room?</li>
          <li>Decide what you want them to do and clearly explain this at the start of each session.</li>
          <li>How will you get the whole group's attention?</li>
          <li>Most schools have signals that the children will be familiar with (e.g. raising one hand, counting down from 5, clapping). Ask what the teachers in your school do and use the same, or invent one of your own!</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Tell children when the club is half way through, and tell them again when they have 5 minutes left. This will mean they know how long they have left to finish their projects.</p>

        <p>At the end of each session it might be a good idea to have a five or ten minute catch up with the group. You could get them all to save and log off and then discuss what they have learnt during the session, including the key concepts that have been covered. What did they find most fun? Easy? Difficult? How did they overcome any difficulties they faced? This is also a good time to thank them for their hard work and perhaps mention a few individuals you feel have worked particularly hard.</p>

        <p><strong>Positivity</strong></p>

        <p>Children learn best in a calm and positive environment where their efforts are noticed and commended. Here are some tips to help you achieve this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Always speak calmly, politely and enthusiastically to the children.</li>
          <li>Do not criticise them or raise your voice.</li>
          <li>You should model the behaviour you expect from them, positivity breeds positivity!</li>
          <li>Most schools have reward systems (house points, sticker books etc.). Find out if the school are happy for you to use theirs, and if so reward children for good effort and behaviour as you see fit.</li>
          <li>Try to focus on good behaviour rather than poor. Praise the children who are doing the right things constantly (and loudly!). If a child is not doing what you expect them to do then quietly remind them what they should be doing. There should always be a teacher from the school to help you deal with any disruptive behaviour.</li>
          <li>Ask the teacher if Code Club certificates can be given out in assembly. This will give the children's achievements a high profile in the school.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><strong>Differentiation</strong></p>

        <p>Differentiation is teacher speak for adapting lessons to suit the different needs of the children in the group. Doing the following will mean all children can learn happily in your Code Club.</p>

        <p>Find out from the teacher if there are any children with Special Education Needs (SEN) in the group. Ask what you can do to help them during the time they spend with you.</p>

        <p>Find out if there are any children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) in the group. These children could find following lots of instructions in English difficult so they might require additional attention and time. You could consider pairing them with a child who can read English well.</p>

        <p>Remember all children have different strengths and learn at different paces so be patient and give them time to work things out for themselves. If there is a child who is consistently struggling with the tasks then consider pairing them with a more able child for some of the work.</p>

        <p>At the end of most projects are some 'Challenge' tasks. These can be used to stretch more able children, but all children should be encouraged to try them once they have finished the core tasks.</p>

        <h3>Finding a volunteer</h3>

        <p>If you have a venue suitable for running a Code Club - a school, a library, a youth centre, for example - but you don't feel qualified to run a club yourself then you'll need to find a volunteer.</p>

        <p>Chat to friends. Email or write home to parents or to local newspapers and community websites. Use Twitter, Facebook, Forums or anything else you can think of.</p>

        <p>You'll need to meet with your volunteer and talk about how to take it forward. Agree on a day of the week and a time.</p>

        <p>And then start advertising your club!</p>

        <p><em>Please remember that a Code Club should always be free! This is one of our core tenets, and we provide all the materials and resources for free, so you should do the same.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Comply with local law</strong></p>

        <p>The important thing is the make sure that you comply with your country’s laws. Many countries require you to have a background check if you want to work with children, and many venues require you to have insurance. Some venues may cover you, others may not. Check with your local government website and make sure that you are following the law. The last thing we want is for you to get into any trouble!

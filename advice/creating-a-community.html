        <h3>Creating a community</h3>

        <p><strong>Translation</strong></p>

        <p>We’ll provide all of the Code Club materials in plaintext form - and we need you to use Github and translate them into your own language. Work together on this and it will be done in no time at all. You'll notice that the materials have not been designed, they are just in markdown. If you want your country's materials designed you'll need to find a designer to do this for you.</p>

        <p><strong>Community-led</strong></p>

        <p>Unfortunately we don't have the resources to support every club in the world from the UK, so you must look to the developer and teacher communities in your own country and create a support network. See below for tips on how to do this.</p>

        <h4>How to set up your Code Club World Community</h4>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Use social media
        Set up a Twitter account for Code Club World in your countryTwitter is great for getting in touch with each other and spreading the word. Maybe use a hashtag for example <em>#CodeClubNorway</em> so that people can find you. Set up a Facebook page for Code Club World in your country, this will help people find each other and it a great place to offer support.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use forums
        We’ve had great success using free sites such as <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!overview">Google Groups</a>. It’s a great way to support each other, ask questions and generally stay in touch with other volunteers.</p></li>
        <li><p>Speak to the press
        Can you tell your national and local press about Code Club? Maybe they would like to visit some of your clubs?</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange meet-ups
        In the UK, many of our volunteers organise regular meet ups, where they can meet other volunteers face-to-face, share experiences, updates and news. It also helps to create a sense of community, so you’re not just working on your own.</p></li>
        <li><p>Set up a website and use our API
        Another great way to keep in touch and share any materials and information about meet ups. If you set up a website for your country please use our API to let clubs registering via your site appear ono our site then clubs from your country that register on codeclubworld.org will appear on any map. Read the <a href="http://docs.codeclubworld.apiary.io/">API documentation</a> here. Here is a <a href="http://codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CodeClubWorld-Assets.zip">folder of assets</a> you can use on your country's website. It is a good idea to have a lawyer look at your website to make sure you are giving people the correct advice and that it complies with the law in your country.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you decide to run Code Club World in your country, remember that it can be quite time consuming. You might want to put together a team of dedicated volunteers to help you run it. You might even need to look for funding if it becomes very successful. Look to local technology companies for help as well as grant giving organisations in your region. </p></li>
        </ul>


        <p><strong>Support each other!</strong></p>

        <p>Creating this community is vital, and will help your country’s Code Clubs to thrive. We don’t have the facilities to support outside of the UK so it’s important that you’re all there to help each other!</p>
